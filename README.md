#burnr
Track your monthly personal burn rate

## Usage
Completely front-end based. Uses LocalStorage for storage. May require
 running from a server however. If you have Python installed you can
use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` which will host the current directory
at http://$HOSTNAME:8000.

## TODO

* determine if localstorage works from file system
* expose the total
* style expenses
* plot expenses on month-like view
* graphs for monthly cash usage
